# Tic Tac Toe 
A simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns to mark X or O in the grid. The game checks for a win or tie after each move. When a player wins or a tie occurs, a centered dialog box pops up showing the result. You can reset the game using buttons or automatically when the dialog is closed. This is a vanilla JavaScript project â€” no external libraries or frameworks are used, making it lightweight and beginner-friendly.
